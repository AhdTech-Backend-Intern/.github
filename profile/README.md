    - Converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa with Jackson.
  - **Error Handling**:
    - Standardized API responses with proper error messages and status codes.
  - **Postman Testing**:
    - Testing endpoints with Postman collections.
- **Outcome**: Build and test robust RESTful APIs.


## **Week 4: Data Persistence with Spring Data JPA**
- **Objective**: Introduce relational database interaction using Spring Data JPA.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Database Fundamentals**:
    - Relational database concepts (tables, relationships, normalization).
    - Basic SQL queries: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
  - **Spring Data JPA**:
    - Configuring JPA and Hibernate.
    - Creating repositories for CRUD operations using `JpaRepository`.
  - **Entity Modeling**:
    - Mapping Java objects to database tables with JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Column`).
    - Managing relationships: `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@ManyToMany`.
  - **H2 Database**:
    - Using H2 for quick development.
  - **Advanced Queries**:
    - Writing custom JPQL and native SQL queries.
- **Outcome**: Seamlessly connect your applications to a database for CRUD operations.


## **Week 5: Spring Security and Authentication**
- **Objective**: Secure applications with authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Spring Security Basics**:
    - Protecting endpoints with `@PreAuthorize` and role-based access.
    - Customizing security filters.
  - **JWT Authentication**:
    - Generating and validating JWT tokens.
    - Stateless authentication for REST APIs.
  - **Password Encryption**:
    - Secure passwords using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.
  - **Role-Based Access Control**:
    - Managing user roles (e.g., ADMIN, USER) and restricting access.
- **Outcome**: Implement robust authentication and authorization.


## **Week 6: Advanced Topics like Microservices and Spring Cloud**
- **Objective**: Understand microservices architecture and distributed systems.
- **Topics Covered**:
